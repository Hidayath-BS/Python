# Python summary

- Python was developed by Guido Van Rossum 1991, python combines features of c and Java.
- Feature: Simple, Easy to learn, Open Source, High-Level Language, Platform independent, Procedure and object oriented.
- A class is a blueprint for declaring and creating objects. An object is a class instance that allows programmers to use variables and methods from inside the class.
- A class does not exist physically, A class is only an abstract idea that represent the common behavior of several objects, this imaginary picture is called a class. ex-dog class(variable: height, age,color. method: barking, eating,  running)
- A scripting language is a programming language that does not use a compiler for execution of the source code. it uses an interpreter to translate the source code into machine code on the fly(while running)
- source code ->(compiler)-> byte code(set of instruction) ->(PVM/interpeter)-> machine code(binary) -> computer
- JIT just in time, PVM python virtual machine, JIT is faster than the interpreter(line by line).
- Everything is considered an object in Python. even modules are also objects.
- memory allocation and deallocation are done during runtime automatically, all these objects are stored on a separate memory called heap.
- a variable is seen as a tag or name that is tied to some value,(a=1) which means the value '1' is created first in memory and then a tag by the name 'a'.
- DataType: None type, boolean, Numeric(int, float, complex), Sequences(str, bytes,list, tuple, range), Sets(set, frozen set), Mapping(dict).
- None type object does not contain any value, 'None' is used inside the function as the default value.
- the list[] can store diff types of elements and can grow dynamically in memory.
- tuple () elements can not be modified and the set {} is an unordered collection of elements and does not allow duplicate values.
- Operators: Arithmetic(+ _ * / % **), Assignment(= += -= *= /= %= **= //=), unary(-), Relational(> >= < <= == !=), Logical(and or not), Boolean(true and true = true, False or false = false), Bitwise, Membership(in not in), Identity(Is is not).
- an operator is a symbol that performs an operation and acts on some variables called operands.
- math function: sqrt, ceil, floor factorial, pow, gcd
- a,b = [int (x) for x in input ("enter two number").split(',')
- control statement: if, if else, if elif else, while loop, for loop, else suite, break, continue,pass, assert, return.
- the group of statement in python is called suite.
- synatx: assert expression, message 
- array use less memory than lists and they offer faster execution than list.
- import array, a = array.array('i',[5,6,7])
- array methods: append,count, extend, index, pop, remove.
- numpy is package that contains serveral classes, functions, variable etc to deal with scientific calculation in python.
- vectorized operation: dividing or adding of 2 arrays called vectorized operation, these are fast, syntactically clear, compact code.
- math operation on arrays: sum, prod,min,max,mean,sort.
- any () function can be used to determine if any one element of the array is true.
- all() function can be used to determine whether all elements in the array are true.
- c = where (a>b , a , b)
