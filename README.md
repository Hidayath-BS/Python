# Python summary

-Python was developed by Guido Van Rossum 1991, python combines features of c and Java.
-Feature: Simple, Easy to learn, Open Source, High-Level Language, Platform independent, Procedure and object oriented.
-A class is a blueprint for declaring and creating objects. An object is a class instance that allows programmers to use variables and methods from inside the class.
-A class does not exist physically, A class is only an abstract idea that represent the common behavior of several objects, this imaginary picture is called a class. ex-dog class(variable: height, age,color. method: barking, eating,  running)
-A scripting language is a programming language that does not use a compiler for execution of the source code. it uses an interpreter to translate the source code into machine code on the fly(while running)
-source code ->(compiler)-> byte code(set of instruction) ->(PVM/interpeter)-> machine code(binary) -> computer
-JIT just in time, PVM python virtual machine, JIT is faster than the interpreter(line by line).
-Everything is considered an object in Python. even modules are also objects.
-memory allocation and deallocation are done during runtime automatically, all these objects are stored on a separate memory called heap.
